# ANN-customer-churn-prediction
This project predicts whether a customer will leave a bank ("churn") using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on historical customer data. The model analyzes features like credit score, account balance, demographics, and activity to classify at-risk customers. A Streamlit-based web app provides an interactive interface for prediction.
